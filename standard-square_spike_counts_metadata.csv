"cellid","The ID of the cell. First two numbers indicate the monkey. The next two letters are assigned for a given electrode position along the cortical surface (ignores depth). The number indicates the recording channel. The last letter differentiates the cells that were recorded."
"rep","Increments for each batch of stimuli presentations."
"OR","The preferred orientation of the cell."
"SideBySq","The side of the figure, as encoded by the preferred side-of-figure as determined by the standard square test."
"NumSpikes","The number of spikes elicited within 40 to 300 ms after stimulus onset."
"Anscombe_Spikes","The Anscombe transformed spike counts."
"SpikeRate_Hz","The spike rate in spikes per second."
"Color_R_100","Red channel of the either the square or the background (depending on LC and Side, value 0 to 100)."
"Color_G_100","Green channel of the either the square or the background (depending on LC and Side, value 0 to 100)."
"Color_B_100","Blue channel of the either the square or the background (depending on LC and Side, value 0 to 100)."
"LC","Codes for the local contrast polarity."
"CRF_VisualField_PosX_arcmin","The position of the receptive field center, along the horizontal of the visual field. In arcminutes."
"CRF_VisualFIeld_PosY_arcmin","The position of the receptive field center, along the vertical of the visual field. In arcminutes."
"cmd_item","An ID for the ""command item"", which gives the variables for a given stimulus."
"Presentation_ID","An ID for a specific presentation of the stimulus."
