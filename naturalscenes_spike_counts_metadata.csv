"column","description"
"cellid","The ID of the cell. First two numbers indicate the monkey. The next two letters are assigned for a given electrode position along the cortical surface (ignores depth). The number indicates the recording channel. The last letter differentiates the cells that were recorded."
"rep","Increments for each batch of stimuli presentations."
"OR","The preferred orientation of the cell in degrees (0 is horizontal, clockwise rotation)."
"OR2","The orientation of the border in the image used to align the border to the cell's preferred orientation"
"OR3","The rotation used to manipulate the side of the occluding figure"
"Patch","Whether the full image (0) or patch (1) was presented"
"CRFd_arcmin","Classical receptive field size in arcminutes of the visual field."
"ScenePos","The ID for a given scene position. Includes scene number and X and Y positions."
"ARCMINPERPIX","Scaling used to fit the patch over the CRF."
"FigSide","The side of the figure (for OR+OR2+OR3=0, the occluding figure will be above)."
"SideBySq","The side of the figure, as encoded by the preferred side-of-figure as determined by the standard square test."
"NumSpikes","The number of spikes elicited within 40 to 300 ms after stimulus onset."
"Anscombe_Spikes","The Anscombe transformed spike counts."
"SpikeRate_Hz","The spike rate in spikes per second."
"ImagePath","The path of the image used for stimulus"
"CRF_VisualField_FullImage_PosX_pixels","The position of the receptive field center, along the X/horizontal coordinate of the full image. In pixels."
"CRF_VisualField_FullImage_PosY_pixels","The position of the receptive field center, along the Y/vertical coordinates of the full image. In pixels."
"FullImageWidth","Width of the full image in pixels."
"FullImageHeight","Height of the full image in pixels."
"Background_RGB","The RGB values used for the background."
"CRF_VisualField_PosX_arcmin","The position of the receptive field center, along the horizontal of the visual field. In arcminutes."
"CRF_VisualFIeld_PosY_arcmin","The position of the receptive field center, along the vertical of the visual field. In arcminutes."
"cmd_item","An ID for the ""command item"", which gives the variables for a given stimulus."
"Presentation_ID","An ID for a specific presentation of the stimulus."
"InvertColor","Whether the color of the image was inverted (1) or not (0)."
