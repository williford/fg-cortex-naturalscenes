* **standard-square_spike_counts.csv** - results from each square stimulus presentation.
* **standard-square_spikes.csv** - individual spike times of each square stimulus presentation.
* **naturalscenes_spike_counts.csv** - results from each natural scene stimulus presentation.
* **naturalscenes_spikes.csv** - individual spike times of each natural scene stimulus presentation.
* **scenept-borderown.csv** - border-ownership coding of each scene point presented to each cell. Contains substantial trial-by-trial variation.

Each of these files has a corresponding "_metadata.csv" file.
