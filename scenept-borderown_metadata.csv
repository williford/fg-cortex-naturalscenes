"column","description"
"cellid","The ID of the cell. First two numbers indicate the monkey. The next two letters are assigned for a given electrode position along the cortical surface (ignores depth). The number indicates the recording channel. The last letter differentiates the cells that were recorded."
"ScenePt","The ID for a given scene position. Includes scene number and X and Y positions."
"obj_pref_side_patch","The Anscombe transformed spike counts for the patch condition when the object is on the preferred side (determined by the standard square test)."
"obj_nonpref_side_patch","The Anscombe transformed spike counts for the patch condition when the object is on the non-preferred side (determined by the standard square test)."
"obj_pref_side_full","The Anscombe transformed spike counts for the full image condition when the object is on the preferred side (determined by the standard square test)."
"obj_nonpref_side_full","The Anscombe transformed spike counts for the full image condition when the object is on the non-preferred side (determined by the standard square test)."
"bos_full","The border-ownership effect with the full image conditions of the scene point (Anscombe transformed spike counts)."
"bos_patch","The border-ownership effect with the patch conditions of the scene point (Anscombe transformed spike counts)."
"bos_context","The border-ownership effect elicited by the context (full - patch) of the scene point (Anscombe transformed spike counts)."
"residual_std_err","The residual error of the model fit."
"total_pres","Number of presentations for all the 8 conditions of a scene point."
"avg_pres_per_cond","Average number of presentations for each of the 8 conditions of a scene point."
